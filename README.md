# MeetLocker

## Description

_Duration: 2 Week Sprint_

Directly above this is how long it took you to develop the project. Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it? 

The Meetlocker app is a mobile friendly react.js app that allows cabin-goers to keep track of event dates, experiences, and bagged animals for their cabin.  Hunters can create and delete their own events, post logs and comments to the camp log page as well as see what other users have posted, and submit recent trophies for evaluation by the cabin admin.

We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries,
