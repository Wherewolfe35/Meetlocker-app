## Description

_Duration: 2 Week Sprint_

Directly above this is how long it took you to develop the project. Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

## Screen Shot

Include one or two screen shots of your project here (optional). Remove if unused.

### Prerequisites

Link to software that is required to install the app (e.g. node).

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- List other prerequisites here

## Installation

How do you get your application up and running? This is a step by step list for how another developer could get this project up and running. The good target audience in terms of knowledge, would be a fellow Primer from another cohort being able to spin up this project. Note that you do not need a paragraph here to intro Installation. It should be step-by-step.

If your application has secret keys (for example --  Twilio), make sure you tell them how to set that up, both in getting the key and then what to call it in the `.env` file.

1. Create a database named `your database name`,
2. The queries in the `tables.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!

## Development Setup Instructions

* Run `npm install`
* Create a `.env` file at the root of the project and paste this line into the file:
    ```
    SERVER_SESSION_SECRET=superDuperSecret
    ```
    While you're in your new `.env` file, take the time to replace `superDuperSecret` with some long random string like `25POUbVtx6RKVNWszd9ERB9Bb6` to keep your application secure. Here's a site that can help you: [https://passwordsgenerator.net/](https://passwordsgenerator.net/). If you don't do this step, create a secret with less than eight characters, or leave it as `superDuperSecret`, you will get a warning.
* Start postgres if not running already by using `brew services start postgresql`
* Run `npm run server`
* Run `npm run client`
* Navigate to `localhost:3000`

## Production Build

Before pushing to Heroku, run `npm run build` in terminal. This will create a build folder that contains the code Heroku will be pointed at. You can test this build by typing `npm start`. Keep in mind that `npm start` will let you preview the production build but will **not** auto update.

* Start postgres if not running already by using `brew services start postgresql`
* Run `npm start`
* Navigate to `localhost:5000`

## Lay of the Land

* `src/` contains the React application
* `public/` contains static assets for the client-side
* `build/` after you build the project, contains the transpiled code from `src/` and `public/` that will be viewed on the production site
* `server/` contains the Express App

## Deployment

1. Create a new Heroku project
1. Link the Heroku project to the project GitHub Repo
1. Create an Heroku Postgres database
1. Connect to the Heroku Postgres database from Postico
1. Create the necessary tables
1. Add an environment variable for `SERVER_SESSION_SECRET` with a nice random string for security
1. In the deploy section, select manual deploy
